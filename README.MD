# 🚀 AI-Powered SOC Agent

## 📌 Overview
The AI-powered SOC (Security Operations Center) Agent is designed to analyze security logs, commands, and alerts, map them to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs, and provide tailored mitigation suggestions. This enables SOC teams to **rapidly detect, analyze, and respond** to security incidents.

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Threat Detection** – Parses security logs and alerts to identify threats.  
✅ **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** – Uses vector search (FAISS) to match logs to **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**.  
✅ **Graph-Based Attack Tracking** – Neo4j stores and visualizes attack progression over time.  
✅ **AI-Powered Security Recommendations** – Falcon LLM generates **customized mitigation steps**.  
✅ **Real-Time SOC Integration** – FastAPI endpoint (`/analyze/`) enables **live** threat detection.  

## 🏗️ Architecture
1️⃣ **Log Parsing & Preprocessing** – Extracts meaningful data from SOC logs.  
2️⃣ **Vector Search with FAISS** – Matches logs to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**.  
3️⃣ **Graph-Based Attack Correlation** – Uses Neo4j to track **multi-stage attack patterns**.  
4️⃣ **LLM-Driven Recommendations** – Falcon LLM generates **remediation steps** based on attack techniques.  
5️⃣ **API for Integration** – FastAPI exposes an endpoint for **real-time** analysis & integration.  

## 📦 Installation
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-soc-agent.git
cd ai-soc-agent
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Start the API Server**
```sh
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## 🛠 Usage
### **Send Log Data for Analysis**
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "log": "Suspicious PowerShell execution detected",
  "source": "SIEM"
}'
```
📌 **Response:** The API returns the mapped **MITRE ATT&CK TTPs** and **mitigation suggestions**.

## 🚀 How to Make it Fully Autonomous
To move from recommendations to **automated response**, we can:
1️⃣ **Integrate with SIEMs & EDR** (e.g., **CrowdStrike, SentinelOne**) for live log ingestion.  
2️⃣ **Automate response actions** (e.g., **blocking an IP, killing a process**).  
3️⃣ **Use Reinforcement Learning** to improve decision-making over time.  
4️⃣ **Enable continuous learning** by training on real-world attack data.  

## 📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 **Incident Severity Scoring** – Prioritize high-risk threats based on attack correlation.  
🔹 **Automated Playbooks** – Generate **custom** security workflows per attack type.  
🔹 **Enhanced Real-Time Alerting** – Integration with **Slack, PagerDuty, or SIEMs**.
